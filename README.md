# Movie App

This is a very basic Movie App that allows you to see all of the available movies that are in the dabase.  You can select or deselect your favorite movies by clicking on the heart icon in the top left corner.  The app runs a tad bit differently in GitHub pages than it did in VS Code, but the core functionality is still the same. https://audreyrwilliams.github.io/Movie-App/

(1) Below is the page that will greet you when you first click on the web link.  <img width="668" height="751" alt="Screen Shot 2025-07-15 at 1 01 50 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6e1a62c7-184b-4d82-84e2-da40611614f4" /> <hr>
(2) As seen in the image below, you can click on either the 'Movie App' link or the 'Home' link to reach this page.  This page is a listing of all available movies stored in the database that we're accessing through a free API. <img width="847" height="943" alt="Screen Shot 2025-07-15 at 1 13 05 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6413a57e-d288-4b3d-9efa-fd3cced88ee3" /> <hr>
(3) This is how your blank 'Favorites' page looks before you select any favorite movies.  <img width="860" height="644" alt="Screen Shot 2025-07-15 at 1 13 56 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ffb28a4d-317c-4891-b2dc-67666d2e63ab" /> <hr>
(4) When you click on a movie on your 'Home' page, an overlay will appear with a heart icon in the top left hand corner.  You can click on this icon so that this movie will then appear on your 'Favorites' page, and the heart then turns red.  You can deselect from either the 'Home' or 'Favorites' pages. Please see the example below where the Superman movie is selected as a favorite.
