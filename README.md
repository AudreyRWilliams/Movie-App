# Movie App

This is a very basic Movie App that allows you to see all of the available movies that are in the dabase.  You can select or deselect your favorite movies by clicking on the heart icon in the top left corner.  The app runs a tad bit differently in GitHub pages than it did in VS Code, but the core functionality is still the same. https://audreyrwilliams.github.io/Movie-App/
